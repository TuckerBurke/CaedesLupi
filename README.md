# CaedesLupi
## About
Caedes Lupi is a group project created for Game Design and Development II at RIT. Enemy logic was never fully implemented in game. Added some additional visual polish after course completion. Uses A and D for movement, SPACE to lunge attack, and tap left click to maul mounted enemy. Press ESC to return to main menu and quit. You can download the build [here](Build/CaedesLupiBuild.zip) if you would like to play.
## Documentation
This game was created in Unity Engine 2019.0.010f1 using C#. I created all of the visual art in Photoshop and animated using Esoteric Spine. This was my first time fully implementing Spine animations in Unity. I had to learn Unity's Animator state machine. I wound up having to expand / refactor  player control logic in order to properly transition between all animated states. Came up with some creative solutions to transition between human and wolf forms and to properly carry an enemy when attacked. This was a great learning experience and came out pretty well for a small scale group project. Polished it up a little bit visually for portfolio use and would like to revisit this prototype in the future to flesh out enemy logic and additional levels. The wolf was inspired by World of Warcraft and the human form was inspired by Marv in Sin City.
